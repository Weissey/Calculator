Starting this project, I wasn't very confident I could make the calculator functional at all. The end product is definitely better than what I expected, but this all wasn't without setbacks. To begin, I need more practice with callback functions as it could greatly increase the efficiency of my code, especially within this project.

The calculator still has a feature that I've been unable to complete, and that's the feature of the calculator automatically completing evalation when the user chooses to not press the "=" sign and to keep using operators, such as continuously using "+" to get the sum. I spent hours trying to get this feature to work, all to give up at the end and to resort to tooltips to aid the user.

The design also could be improved, but as of now it includes a link to my Github, as well as a consistent color palette.
